* Possibility to paste text to the emulator (on X11 and possibly Win32)

* Disk swapping facility (probably OS-specific too, possibly drag'n'drop).

* Support for keyboards other than QWERTY (like the infamous French
  keyboard). We need help from people who have access to "Apple IIGS
  Firmware Reference" manual.

* Support for displaying foreign character sets

* There is probably a bug in the ADB code which keeps the
  language-switching C-OA-ESC control panel from working on ROM01

Can somebody tell me why the "translation" item from the "general"
control panel of GS/OS 6.01 has no effect on the "video keyboard", and
how it is supposed to work? At ADB level or at the toolbox level?

What key codes should ADB return for dead keys and accents?
